# Central Limit Theorem demonstration based on simulation

This Shiny app is built using Shinylive, which allows it to run entirely on the frontend without the need for a server. However, this also means that it may take some time to load in the web browser. The app displays the histogram of the sample distribution, as well as the histogram and normal quantile plot of the sampling distribution of the sample mean for simulated samples drawn from various distributions, such as normal, uniform, chi-squared, and others. The app demonstrates that the sampling distribution of the mean will always be approximately normal, as long as the sample size is large enough.
